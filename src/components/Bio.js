              CANCEL THE TRANSMISSION serve up thumping rock thrusts and
              engaging hooks with burly muscular riffs. The South Wales rockers
              have been tearing up a storm since their inception, and the
              buoyant quartet are now planning their attack to break out with
              their spanking new single, Rise Again, which is out now. Watch the
              lyric video to the track, here – https://youtu.be/NMicLfLBUOY.

              Hailing from Caerphilly, South Wales, and formed in 2015, CANCEL
              THE TRANSMISSION are poised to rip the veil from the face of
              today’s air-brushed music scene. By taking cues from classic rock
              icons such as Guns N’ Roses, AC/DC and Aerosmith, as well as
              pulling from modern rock heavyweights such as The Darkness, Alter
              Bridge, and The Treatment, CANCEL THE TRANSMISSION have developed
              a style and sound that expresses feel-good hard rock anthems,
              loaded with raunchy riffs and infectious hooks.
            </p>

            <p>
              CANCEL THE TRANSMISSION earned a heap of praise from many revered
              websites and radio stations for their debut four-track EP, Back To
              The Start. Additionally, the band’s debut album, Live It Up, which
              dropped at the end of 2019, moved the foursome up to a higher
              level. The record gained rampant support from the New Wave of
              classic Rock community and widened the group’s base. Live shows
              and prominent festival appearances throughout the UK also assisted
              with the band’s upward trajectory.

              The soaring Brit rockers will advance even further with the
              release of their new single, Rise Again. The track is a
              hard-hitting, and outrageously catchy slab of good time rock and
              roll. With live dates already planned for later this year, along
              with a plethora of new material, 2021 is the year for CANCEL THE
              TRANSMISSION.
